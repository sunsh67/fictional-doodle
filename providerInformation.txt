I have a 4.5 yr old 12 lb Pomeranian that enjoys visiting parks    and night time cuddle sessions. I live in a 1,000 sq foot condo    across the street from Fairview park where all the neighborhood dogs  go to play. I'm a working professional with a flexible schedule. I   enjoy taking pictures and can provide frequent updates (if you like)  of your dog as well as send video clips. I live alone with my dog, Benjamin and both of us will be more than happy to welcome your furry companion into our home :). Thanks for checking out our profile!"

I've always been the go-to pet sitter for all of my family and friends whenever they're out of town and their dogs and cats have become my 4-legged nieces and nephews -- gotta live up to that Uncle Jesse title. Your pets will always be treated as family in my book."

My job allows me to have full days off with out any distractions so I am free to play and care as long as you may need. I understand how stressful it may be to leave your family member for the day or night so however I can be of help to alleviate that worry is what I'm here for! Hope to meet your pal soon while creating a new trusted and reliable sitter for you!"

Can run, walk, hike w/ dog depending on preference. I have been apart of two separate puppy births, assisted in one, watched the other. I live with 4 dogs now, 2 30-35 lbs mutts, a 55 lb german shepherd collie mix and 65 lb Husky lab mix and walk them all at once at least once a day. You can count of me to be timely, professional and respectful. I follow instructions well and will provide regular updates of my time with your pets. Happy to help out whenever you need it!"

Close by are several parks, a beach we walk to and a dog park only a 4 min drive away! There is almost always at least one adult home at all times. We have our own 5 year old lab mix, Obi, who is friendly, a good playmate and just plain fun to have around. He enjoys having play-friends come over to visit, but won't smother them if they need their space. We would love the opportunity to care for your dog. Whether it's a few nights, just the day or you need someone to run over to walk pooch for 30 minutes please don't hesitate to call us!"
